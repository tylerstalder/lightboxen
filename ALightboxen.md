Lightboxen

Features

* Displays photos from 20 top Instagram users
* Lightbox any user's feed
* Show captions on hover
* Navigate through feed using arrow keys or ui controls 

Spec

* The ability to access to a public API and successfully retrieve data from it,
* The ability to display that data on a page using only native JavaScript (no libraries)
* The ability to update the UI of a page without refreshing the page

Iâ€™d like you to create a web page that shows a photo in a lightbox view,
with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the
photo title. You can use any public API that returns photos; here are
some ideas:

 * Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html (You can use this set ID if you like: 72157626579923453)
 * Instagram: http://instagram.com/developer/
 * Google Image Search: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview
 * Yahoo Image Search: https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/
