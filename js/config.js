This compound, created to host art, entertainment and food for the masses who will descend upon NYC famed Coney Island beaches this summer will last until September with artists adding art as the Summer goes from mild to scorching hot to mild again. @hownosm #howandnosm #coneyisland #coneyartwalls #brooklyn #nyc #streetart #muralarts #graffiti @coneyislandartwalls","link":"https://instagram.com/p/2-u6PrNEA_/"}]},{"id":4803655,"name":"hirozzzz","photos":[{"id":"990981585643316105_4803655","url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfa1/t51.2885-15/e15/11325947_359328794278138_1387925030_n.jpg","user":"Hiroaki Fukuda","caption":null,"link":"https://instagram.com/p/3ArIBvOSOJ/"}]},{"id":1073351,"name":"lavicvic","photos":[{"id":"990549176137048427_1073351","url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/e15/11272336_848495351892338_65198737_n.jpg","user":"VickyNavarro","caption":"Amor es: Ir al mar, tomar horchata con fartons, caminar descalza en la arena, tomar fotos de un pulpo ahorcando a un pollo, re√≠r mucho con bonita compa√±ia y estrenar estas lindas cangrejeras. \nGracias @hectormerienda @jennifermerienda \nAmor es igual a Merienda ‚öìÔ∏è‚ú®\nüíô","link":"https://instagram.com/p/2_IzpANGFr/"}]},{"id":152721,"name":"adamsenatori","photos":[{"id":"987664268883823343_152721","url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/e15/11326134_1409325289391389_156861319_n.jpg","user":"Photographer.

I like to tell a story, or give some history; or just in some way bring you right into a moment with me. This time, all I want to share is that I saw this car during a tour of Santiago with @stgoadventures and I just had to stop and take a photo of it. I loved the color of the building on the left, I loved that the VW was bright silver. I loved that the VW reminded me of home because it's the car my mother was driving when I was a kid. Basically, I just liked the whole scene and since #soloparking shots are always fun to post on Instagram, and there's a bit of a community behind them...well, I thought I'd take a break from the usual.
